          <span class="title-project">ABOUT ME</span>
          <p>Twenty-four years ago, I entered the realm of existence as I witnessed the first light of day. In my early days, creativity became my constant companion, manifesting through endless writings and an abundance of glued creations. Over the years, I developed a questionably healthy interest and curiosity towards computers, with a particular focus on video games. I always wondered how they were made, and instead of merely playing games, I found myself immersed in level editors and game engines, fueling a curiosity that sculpted me into the game programmer I am today.</p>
          <p>In 2022, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from El-Shorouk Academy. I continued my quest for knowledge by enrolling in the Game Development Academy within ITI, specializing in their game development track. However, that was merely the commencement of my journey—a journey that demanded continuous self-improvement to keep pace with the ever-evolving industry.</p>
          <p>I've learned many things along the way, gathered new insights, and gained different perspectives. Embracing new engines, mastering diverse tools, expanding my network, and enhancing my scripting abilities are just a few aspects of my continuous growth. In my spare moments, I delve into personal projects, ranging from commercial endeavors to small hobby creations—each undertaking contributing to my perpetual quest for learning.</p>
